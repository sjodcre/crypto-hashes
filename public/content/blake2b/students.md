# BLAKE2b for Students

BLAKE2b is a super-efficient cryptographic hash function.

### Why Itâ€™s Cool:

- Faster than SHA-256
- Shorter, more flexible output sizes
- Still secure â€” no known attacks
- Based on the same math as ChaCha/Salsa ciphers

Itâ€™s often used in password hashing, file checksums, and apps that need **speed + security**.
