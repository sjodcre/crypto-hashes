# BLAKE2b for Engineers

BLAKE2b is a high-speed cryptographic hash optimized for 64-bit platforms.

## Technical Specs

- Output: 1â€“64 bytes (default 512-bit)
- Internal state: 8Ã—64-bit words
- Compression function: Modified ChaCha (addâ€“rotateâ€“xor)
- Structure: HAIFA
- Optional keyed mode for MAC usage

## Why Use It?

- Faster than SHA-2 and SHA-3
- No collisions, side-channel resistant
- Widely used in libsodium, Argon2, etc.

BLAKE2b is often considered a **secure drop-in replacement** for SHA-2, with better performance and flexibility.
