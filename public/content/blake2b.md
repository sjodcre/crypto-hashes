BLAKE2b is a cryptographic hash function optimized for 64-bit platforms, offering higher speed than MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2, while maintaining strong security.

## Key Features

- **Digest Size**: Up to 512 bits
- **Block Size**: 128 bytes
- **Rounds**: 12
- **Structure**: HAIFA construction with a modified compression function

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Parameters like digest length, key, salt, and personalization are set.

2. **Compression Function**:
   - The core function mixes message blocks with the internal state using a series of permutations and modular additions.

3. **Finalization**:
   - After processing all blocks, the final hash is extracted from the internal state.

## Applications

- File integrity verification
- Password hashing
- Digital signatures
