# BLAKE3 for Engineers

BLAKE3 is a cryptographic hash function designed to be **faster** and more **parallelizable** than its predecessors.

## Technical Specs

- Output: 256-bit (by default)
- Structure: Merkle tree
- Core: Based on BLAKE2sâ€™s compression function
- Deterministic and extendable output (XOF)
- SIMD and multithread friendly

## Highlights

- 3xâ€“7x faster than SHA-256 in practice
- Uses tree hashing for parallelism
- Stateless API: no context needed between calls
- Highly efficient in WASM and embedded systems

## When to Use It

- Hashing large files
- Multi-core processing
- Verifying assets in real-time
