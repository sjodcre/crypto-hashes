# BLAKE3 for Students

BLAKE3 is a modern cryptographic hash function built for speed, parallelism, and efficiency.

### Key Traits:

- 256-bit output (by default)
- Incredibly fast â€” even faster than BLAKE2 or SHA-2
- Built to support multi-threading and SIMD instructions
- Designed using a Merkle tree structure

BLAKE3 is perfect when you need fast hashing at scale â€” like verifying huge files, syncing data, or working across cores.
