# BLAKE3 for Everyone

BLAKE3 is one of the fastest and smartest hash tools ever made.

- It turns any file into a secret-looking code
- It works super fast ‚Äî even with big files
- It can use all the CPU‚Äôs cores to go faster!
- People use it to check files, protect information, or speed up security tools

It‚Äôs new, powerful, and great when performance matters.

## üîç How the Hash Algorithms Compare

| Algorithm   | Output | Popularity    | Speed     | Where It‚Äôs Used                    |
|-------------|--------|----------------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| [SHA-256](/algo/sha256)     | 256-bit| Very Common    | Fast      | Internet, Bitcoin, security        |
| [SHA3-256](/algo/sha3-256)    | 256-bit| Less Common    | Medium    | Future security systems            |
| [BLAKE2b](/algo/blake2b)     | Up to 512-bit | Common  | Very Fast | File tools, apps                   |
| BLAKE3      | 256-bit| New & Powerful | Ultra Fast| High-speed apps, future projects   |
| RIPEMD-160  | 160-bit| Bitcoin only   | Slower    | Bitcoin address creation           |
| Whirlpool   | 512-bit| Niche Use      | Medium    | Archiving, long-term checksums     |
