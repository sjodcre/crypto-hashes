# Whirlpool for Everyone

Whirlpool is like a **big blender** for information. It takes any message and mixes it into a long, 512-bit fingerprint.

- Even a tiny change in the input changes the whole fingerprint
- It‚Äôs not as popular as others, but it‚Äôs **still secure**
- Great for verifying big documents or protecting important data

Whirlpool works best when you need a **very strong, long hash**.

| Algorithm   | Output | Popularity    | Speed     | Where It‚Äôs Used                    |
|-------------|--------|----------------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| [SHA-256](/algo/sha256)     | 256-bit| Very Common    | Fast      | Internet, Bitcoin, security        |
| [SHA3-256](/algo/sha3-256)    | 256-bit| Less Common    | Medium    | Future security systems            |
| [BLAKE2b](/algo/blake2b)     | Up to 512-bit | Common  | Very Fast | File tools, apps                   |
| BLAKE3      | 256-bit| New & Powerful | Ultra Fast| High-speed apps, future projects   |
| RIPEMD-160  | 160-bit| Bitcoin only   | Slower    | Bitcoin address creation           |
| Whirlpool   | 512-bit| Niche Use      | Medium    | Archiving, long-term checksums     |
