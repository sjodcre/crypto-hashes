# Whirlpool for Engineers

Whirlpool is a 512-bit cryptographic hash based on an AES-like block cipher.

## Technical Specs

- Output: 512-bit
- Block size: 512 bits
- Structure: Miyaguchiâ€“Preneel with AES-like operations
- Permutation: 10 rounds of S-box, ShiftRow, MixColumn, AddRoundKey

## Highlights

- ISO/IEC 10118-3 standard
- Resistant to known preimage/collision attacks
- Suitable for archival and checksum validation

Whirlpool is ideal when high entropy and long digests are required, though itâ€™s not as mainstream.
