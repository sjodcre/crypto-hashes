# SHA3-256 for Everyone

SHA3-256 is a newer version of SHA, built differently under the hood.

- It works like a sponge: it absorbs your message and squeezes out a fingerprint
- It's designed to be even more secure than SHA-256
- It's slower, but stronger in some cases
- Great for long-term future-proofing

SHA3 is newer, safer, and becoming more common for advanced security needs.

## üîç How the Hash Algorithms Compare

| Algorithm   | Output | Popularity    | Speed     | Where It‚Äôs Used                    |
|-------------|--------|----------------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| [SHA-256](/algo/sha256)     | 256-bit| Very Common    | Fast      | Internet, Bitcoin, security        |
| [SHA3-256](/algo/sha3-256)    | 256-bit| Less Common    | Medium    | Future security systems            |
| [BLAKE2b](/algo/blake2b)     | Up to 512-bit | Common  | Very Fast | File tools, apps                   |
| BLAKE3      | 256-bit| New & Powerful | Ultra Fast| High-speed apps, future projects   |
| RIPEMD-160  | 160-bit| Bitcoin only   | Slower    | Bitcoin address creation           |
| Whirlpool   | 512-bit| Niche Use      | Medium    | Archiving, long-term checksums     |
