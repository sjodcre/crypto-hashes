# RIPEMD-160 for Students

RIPEMD-160 is a cryptographic hash from the 1990s â€” older, but still in use, especially in Bitcoin.

### Features:
- 160-bit output (smaller than SHA)
- Uses two parallel compression paths for better mixing
- Still secure enough for some use, but not recommended for new systems

ðŸ’¡ Itâ€™s mostly known for one job: generating **Bitcoin addresses**.
