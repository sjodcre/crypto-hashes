# RIPEMD-160 for Engineers

RIPEMD-160 is a 160-bit hash function designed in 1996 as a strengthened version of RIPEMD.

## Technical Details

- Digest size: 160 bits
- Block size: 512 bits
- Construction: Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd
- Notable: Dual independent parallel compression functions

## Usage

- Primary use today: Bitcoin address generation
- Often used in conjunction with SHA-256 (e.g. hash160 = RIPEMD160(SHA256(x)))

‚ö†Ô∏è While still used in crypto ecosystems, it‚Äôs considered outdated for modern security use.
