# RIPEMD-160 for Everyone

RIPEMD-160 is like a **classic lock** ‚Äî not the newest, but still trusted in a few places.

- It gives a short 160-bit code for any message
- You can‚Äôt reverse it or guess it
- It‚Äôs best known for securing **Bitcoin wallet addresses**

While newer methods are faster and stronger, RIPEMD-160 is still in use for legacy systems.

| Algorithm   | Output | Popularity    | Speed     | Where It‚Äôs Used                    |
|-------------|--------|----------------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| [SHA-256](/algo/sha256)     | 256-bit| Very Common    | Fast      | Internet, Bitcoin, security        |
| SHA3-256    | 256-bit| Less Common    | Medium    | Future security systems            |
| BLAKE2b     | Up to 512-bit | Common  | Very Fast | File tools, apps                   |
| BLAKE3      | 256-bit| New & Powerful | Ultra Fast| High-speed apps, future projects   |
| RIPEMD-160  | 160-bit| Bitcoin only   | Slower    | Bitcoin address creation           |
| Whirlpool   | 512-bit| Niche Use      | Medium    | Archiving, long-term checksums     |
