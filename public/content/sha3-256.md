SHA3-256 is part of the SHA-3 family, standardized in 2015. Unlike SHA-2, SHA-3 is based on the Keccak sponge construction, offering resistance to length-extension attacks.

## Key Features

- **Digest Size**: 256 bits
- **Capacity**: 512 bits
- **Rate**: 1088 bits
- **Structure**: Sponge construction

## How It Works

1. **Absorbing Phase**:
   - The input message is padded and divided into blocks.
   - Each block is XORed into the state, followed by the Keccak-f permutation.

2. **Squeezing Phase**:
   - After all blocks are absorbed, the output is extracted from the state in blocks of the rate size until the desired hash length is achieved.

## Applications

- Post-quantum cryptography
- Secure hashing in hardware-constrained environments
