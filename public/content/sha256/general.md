# SHA-256 for Everyone

Imagine a machine that gives a secret fingerprint to any file or message. That‚Äôs SHA-256.

- Change one letter, the fingerprint changes completely.
- No way to go backwards and figure out what was put in.
- It‚Äôs safe, fast, and trusted by banks and cryptocurrencies.

It helps check for tampering, protect passwords, and verify things haven‚Äôt been changed.

## üîç How the Hash Algorithms Compare

| Algorithm   | Output | Popularity    | Speed     | Where It‚Äôs Used                    |
|-------------|--------|----------------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| [SHA-256](/algo/sha256)     | 256-bit| Very Common    | Fast      | Internet, Bitcoin, security        |
| [SHA3-256](/algo/sha3-256)    | 256-bit| Less Common    | Medium    | Future security systems            |
| BLAKE2b     | Up to 512-bit | Common  | Very Fast | File tools, apps                   |
| BLAKE3      | 256-bit| New & Powerful | Ultra Fast| High-speed apps, future projects   |
| RIPEMD-160  | 160-bit| Bitcoin only   | Slower    | Bitcoin address creation           |
| Whirlpool   | 512-bit| Niche Use      | Medium    | Archiving, long-term checksums     |
