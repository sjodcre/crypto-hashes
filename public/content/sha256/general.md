# SHA-256 for General Audience

SHA-256 is a digital fingerprint maker. It takes any input (like a file or password) and transforms it into a fixed-length string that looks random, but is always the same for the same input.

- ðŸ§  Used in: digital security, Bitcoin, verifying file integrity
- ðŸ§® Output: 256-bit hash (64 hex characters)

If even a single character changes in the input, the hash becomes completely different!

Try typing in something and watch the hash change!
