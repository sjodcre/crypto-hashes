# SHA-256 for Kids

SHA-256 is like a magic sticker machine! 🎩

- You put in a word or secret...
- It gives you a long, secret code!
- If you change even one letter, the code changes completely!
- But you can’t figure out what was put in just by looking at the code — it’s magic!

People use SHA-256 to lock up their secrets and check if anything changed without asking.
