# SHA-256 for Kids ðŸ§’

SHA-256 is like a secret magic stamp! ðŸª„

When you put a word or sentence into it, it turns it into a really long code â€” like a special password made just for that word. But if you change even one letter, it makes a totally different code!

- It's used to lock stuff safely
- Computers use it to make sure things havenâ€™t been changed

Try typing your name and see what code it gives!
