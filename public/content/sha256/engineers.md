# SHA-256 for Engineers

SHA-256 is a member of the SHA-2 family, designed by the NSA and standardized by NIST.

## Technical Specs

- Output: 256-bit hash (32 bytes)
- Block size: 512 bits
- Construction: Merkleâ€“DamgÃ¥rd using Daviesâ€“Meyer
- Rounds: 64
- Secure as of 2025

## Algorithm Steps

1. Pad message to 512-bit blocks
2. Initialize eight 32-bit working variables
3. For each block, run 64 rounds using bitwise ops and modular math
4. Concatenate output from internal state

## Use Cases

- Digital signatures
- SSL/TLS
- Bitcoin mining
- File verification
