SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256) is a member of the SHA-2 family, producing a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. It's widely used in various security applications and protocols, including SSL/TLS and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

## Key Features

- **Digest Size**: 256 bits
- **Block Size**: 512 bits
- **Rounds**: 64
- **Structure**: Merkle–Damgård construction

## How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Padding**: The message is padded to ensure its length is congruent to 448 modulo 512.
   - **Parsing**: The padded message is divided into 512-bit blocks.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Eight 32-bit words are initialized as the initial hash value.

3. **Hash Computation**:
   - For each 512-bit block:
     - A message schedule of 64 words is prepared.
     - The compression function processes the block through 64 rounds, updating the hash value.

4. **Finalization**:
   - After processing all blocks, the final hash value is produced by concatenating the updated hash words.

## Applications

- Data integrity verification
- Digital signatures
- Blockchain and cryptocurrency
